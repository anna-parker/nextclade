> ðŸ’¡ We recommend to start with the TSV output file for most users.

See detailed description of the available files in the [Output files](../output-files/index.rst) section.

These are the same files as produced by [Nextclade CLI](../nextclade-cli/index.rst)

For CSV and TSV files, you can choose which columns to include in the output. By default, all columns are included. You can uncheck the columns you don't need.

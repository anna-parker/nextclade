##### Column: row index

Index of the row in the table. Useful for visual search and counting of sorted and filtered results.

Not to be confused with sequence index.

Row indices always start with 0 and are sorted in ascending order. They do not change their position when data is reordered due to sorting or filtering.

Indices are 0-based.

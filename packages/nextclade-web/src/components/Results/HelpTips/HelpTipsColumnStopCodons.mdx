##### Column: premature stop codons

Displays number of unexpected premature stop codons in the sequence.

Displayed in parentheses are the total number of premature stop codons, including known stop codons. Dataset authors may define a list of known good (expected) premature stop codons in the quality control (QC) configuration to prevent them from causing a bad QC score. These stop codons are only included in the number in parentheses.

The usual stop condons at the end of genes (as defined by the reference sequence) are never counted or displayed in this column.

Positions are 1-based.

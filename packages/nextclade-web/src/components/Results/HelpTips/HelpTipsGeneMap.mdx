##### Genome annotation

Shows a schema of the genome: genes are displayed as colored rectangles. Beginning and end of the rectangle correspond to the beginning and end of the gene in genome. The vertical offsets of rectangles represent different reading frames. The numeric axis below the genes shows nucleotide positions in "Nucleotide sequence" view or aminoacid positions (starting from the beginning of the gene) in "Gene" view.

Genome annotation is horizontally aligned with sequence or gene views above it.

Mouse hover over a gene to show gene's details.

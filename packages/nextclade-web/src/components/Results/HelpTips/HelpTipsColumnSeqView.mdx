##### Column: sequence view

In sequence view column, each row displays a schema of the corresponding sequence, highlighting the differences compared to the reference sequence.<br/>

Either "Nucleotide sequence" view or any of the "Gene" views can be selected using the dropdown box.

---

###### Nucleotide Sequence mode

In "Nucleotide Sequence" mode, the whole nucleotide sequence is shown. Line markers represent nucleotide mutations. They are colored by the resulting (query) nucleotide:

<HelpTipsColumnSeqViewNucLegend />

Mouse hover on a mutation marker to show details of that mutation.<br/>
Unsequenced regions at the 5' and 3' end are indicated as light gray areas on both ends.<br/>
For a mapping between positions in the sequence and genes, see Genome Annotation view below the table.<br/>

---

###### Gene mode

When a gene is selected, each row displays a schema of the corresponding sequence by highlighting the differences compared to the reference sequence along the genome.<br/>
Line markers on sequence views represent aminoacid mutations colored by the resulting (query) aminoacid:

<HelpTipsColumnSeqViewGeneLegend />

Note: Sometimes mutations are so close to each other that they overlap.<br/>
Note: Positions are 1-based.<br/>

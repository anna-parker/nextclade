##### Column: frame shifts

Displays total number of unexpected reading frame shifts in the sequence. Shifted ranges are expressed in codon coordinates of the affected gene.

Displayed in parentheses are the total number of frame shifts, including known ones. Dataset authors may define a list of known good (expected) frame shifts in the quality control (QC) configuration to prevent them from causing a bad QC score. These frame shifts are only counted in the number in parentheses.

Positions are 1-based.
